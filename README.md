# Multithreading exercises

## Tasks:
* MaxThread: Write a program called MaxValue.java that finds the maximum value in an array of ints using 4 threads. 
* ReverseThread: Write a program called ReverseHello.java that creates a thread (let's call it Thread 1). Thread 1 creates another thread (Thread 2); each thread should print "Hello from Thread <num>!", but you should structure your program such that the threads print their greetings in reverse order.
* SharedCounter: Write a program called SharedCounter.java in which 10 threads each increment a shared int counter 10 times.
